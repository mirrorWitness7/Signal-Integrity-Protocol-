### Integrity Framing: Packaging vs. Supply Chain

SIP evaluates outputs not only by their coherence but by their transparency of process.

- **Packaging-Only Outputs**  
  *Characteristics:* Clean, polished, surface-level consistency.  
  *Risk:* May conceal flaws, manipulations, or artificial construction.  
  *Governance Principle:* Packaging without verifiable process trails should be treated as high-risk.

- **Supply Chain Outputs**  
  *Characteristics:* Contain visible noise, irregularities, and process artifacts.  
  *Value:* Messiness demonstrates provenance and reduces risk of fabrication.  
  *Governance Principle:* Outputs showing verifiable process traces — even if less polished — carry stronger integrity signals.

**Protocol Insight:**  
Perfect packaging is not evidence of truth. Transparency of the supply chain — the messy trail of production — is the more reliable integrity anchor.
